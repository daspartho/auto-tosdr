The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.
Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.
If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.

In addition to the categories of third parties identified above, during the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Statement, we may have shared personal information about you with government entities, such as in response to requests from law enforcement authorities.5.
California Consumer Privacy RightsYou have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described below.


Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.

Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.

Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.


How to Submit a Request. To submit an access or deletion request, please log into your Foursquare account or call us at (855)-505-8916.
To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, click here or email us at privacy@foursquare.com.
You must provide us with your device identifier, which we will use to fulfill your opt-out request.
If you do not know your device identifier, below are instructions on how to locate it.
We will not use the information you provide as part of your request for any purpose other than to fulfill your opt-out request.

If you use an iOS operating system, a third-party application is required to locate your Apple IDFA.
Please note that we do not control such third-party tools and are not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of your personal information.
If you use an Android operating system, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and select “Ads.” Your Advertising Identifier should be listed at the bottom of the screen.

To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please send us a notarized power of attorney and/or other legal documentation.
Requests from agents that do not submit sufficient proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf will be denied.
For questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section of our Enterprise Services Privacy Policy.

Verifying Requests. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take&nbsp;steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.
If you have an account with us, we are unable to fulfill your access or deletion requests at this time because there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by California law.
The reason for this is that Foursquare historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other information collected through automated means to named actual persons unless the individual uses the Consumer Services.

Additional Information. If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.

Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.
What do I do?
All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.
We do not process any requests related to them.
But sticker sets, channels, and bots on Telegram are publicly available.
If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.
Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?
Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.
To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.
For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.
User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.
Whenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.
Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.
For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.
This goes against our founders' principles.
While we do block terrorist (e.g.
ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions""",310

Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.

If you are not sure whether the GDPR section applies to you, please refer to the text of the regulation here or consult with an attorney as Indiegogo is not able to give you legal advice.
Who is the Data Controller?
Indiegogo is the “data controller” of personal data collected by all of Indiegogo, and we are responsible for deciding how personal data is collected, used, and disclosed.
Campaign Owners may also be data controllers of certain data that you provide to Campaign Owners when you make a Contribution to a Campaign or through any of our other Services.
You should be aware that when you provide information to us using a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform.
The information we collect is covered by the Indiegogo Privacy Policy only, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices.
Privacy choices you have made on the third party’s site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Site or Services.
Please also keep in mind that our Site and Services may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site or Services and to read the policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.
Legal bases for use of your information &amp.
controls and choices
The laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and some other jurisdictions require us to provide Users, to the extent those laws apply to such Users, with the following information:
Legal grounds for use and disclosure of personal information
The legal grounds for use and disclosure of personal information include any of the below reasons:

As necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you, including to provide for Campaign disbursement, manage your Campaign or otherwise comply with the Indiegogo Terms of Use.
On the basis of consent, such as to send you certain information, including marketing communications, to share your information with partners when you have requested we do that, or to collect and process your information for research purposes if you have Contributed to a Campaign, or otherwise agreed.
For our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others such as to ensure the security of our Sites, operate and improve our business and our Sites, respond to your questions, engage in certain marketing, make and receive payments, comply with our legal obligations, prevent fraud, conduct analysis, enforce our Terms, engage in a business change (e.g., sale, merger), to know the User to whom we are providing the Service, and to create anonymous data.
To protect the vital interests of the individual or others.
For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent medical situation.

Controls and choices

In addition, Users in the European Economic Area and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances.
They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect.
They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways (for example, if you opt out of the use of your telephone number for direct marketing, we might still decide to contact you by phone regarding potential fraud on your account).
Users in the European Economic Area have the right to opt-out of all of our processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes.
To exercise this right, you may take control of your data in the top right-hand corner.
The rights and options described above are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law.
In situations in which we process personal data on behalf of our User, we may refer the request to the relevant User and cooperate with their handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that User.
In addition to these rights, Users in the European Economic Area have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.
However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.

How we protect your information and data retention
The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.
We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect User information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification.
We regularly review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.
However, please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.
Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
Data transfers, storage, and processing globally
We operate globally and may transfer your personal information to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this privacy policy.
Wherever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information.
Privacy Shield
To bring you the Services, we operate globally.
Indiegogo complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles (the “Principles”) regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, as described in our EU-US Privacy Shield certification and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certification.
If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us at privacy@indiegogo.com.
As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if you have a dispute with us concerning our adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process and under certain conditions, through the Privacy Shield arbitration process.
Residents of the European Union, United Kingdom, or Switzerland may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue.
(2) seek assistance from our designated independent recourse mechanism above.
and (3) contact the U.S.
Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue.
Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees.
Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual.
Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.
Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal information from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.
As required under the principles, when we receive information under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting on our behalf, Indiegogo has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”).
If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Doist or its third party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums.
The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service.
For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our pricing page.
Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period (e.g., monthly billing periods will be billed on the same day each month).
The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account.
Doist or its third party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information).

 Changes to our Privacy Policy

 Questions?
 The Cloze Services  Cloze organizes and provides efficient means to access and receive updates regarding your contacts that may have been previously dispersed over many different Third Party Platforms.

 “Third Party Platforms” are software that integrate with our Services and that you have authorized to connect with Cloze.
This may include email, calendar, messaging, file storage, phone services, note taking, reminders, social networking, and other cloud services such as Office 365, Gmail, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote and other similar platforms from which you authorize us to import, search, and access, content.
 What Is Personal Information?  “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number or e-mail address, an identification number, location information, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
“Sensitive Personal Information” means racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union members, the processing of genetic, biometric data for purposes of uniquely identifying a natural person, and information concerning an individual’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation.
We treat your Personal and Sensitive Personal Information as confidential.

Personal Information does not include anonymized or “aggregate” information, or publicly available information that has not been combined with Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.""",376

Any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major political parties or political figures


The main point behind this is, while we do encourage free speech and we have no problem with someone saying “thank God” or “Jesus blesses you”, we have to draw the line at an actual discussion, as it often leads to passionate and heated debate and a general distraction from what is ultimately a furry art archive.
The same goes for politics, we know that people want to talk about it, and often do, but there are places for that and they are not here.

Advertisers.
We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.
For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.
We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
Measurement partners.
We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.
Partners offering goods and services in our Products.

Vendors and service providers.
